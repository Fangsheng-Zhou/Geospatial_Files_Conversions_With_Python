# Geospatial Files Conversions With Pythons

##### Update: 11/16/2023

I created some Python scripts to convert geospatial files in order to speed up the analysis process. They are helpful for me to do my research, and they may be helpful for you as well.

Each conversion tool is through Jupyter Notebook. You should have the notebook installed in your Python working environment.

Ideally, you should have a specific working environment for your task. In terms of needed Python modules, I have included them in the text file. You can install these modules in your working environment using "pip install -r Python_Required_Modules.txt."

#### Side note:

During conversion process, your file's attribute table may altered. These tools aren't perfect yet!
